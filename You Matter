 If you're thinking about suicide, don't do it, you are loved, I genuinly care about every single person, no one deserves to leave like that. I love you all <3
 I don't give a damn if you're black, white or any color in between. I don't care if you're Christian, you're Muslim, you're gay, you're straight. I am here to fight for your equality because I believe that we are all born equal. 
Here's a song that may help you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cycUHgg0zzU


YOU ARE NOT ALONE, YOU MATTER, DONT GIVE UP HOPE

Keep your head up Kings and Queens
